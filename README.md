# issuu.com Downloader

Downloads publications from issuu.com when the download option has been disabled for the hosted document. The resulting PDF could be OCR'ed in another step using [pdfocr](https://github.com/gkovacs/pdfocr/) or similar.

In practice the script does not actually download the PDF, but rather downloads the images of the pages of the flash object, and then combines those into a PDF.
